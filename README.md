### Bio
I'm the Sr. Full Stack Web Developer at Hyland's Naturals. I've been doing web development most of my life, which I have my Father to thank. He taught me how to use Microsoft FrontPage when I was 7 years old, and after getting frustrated with the generated HTML, I decided I should learn other ways to build sites. The rest is history. 

I live in Omaha, Nebraska with my wife and two daughters. If you're in Omaha, lets meet up for coffee and chat.
